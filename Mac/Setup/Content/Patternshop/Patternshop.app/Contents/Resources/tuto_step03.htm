</div>
<div class="data">
  <div class="dataPar"> To import an image into a pattern, select it, then use the &quot;File &raquo; Import an image&quot; option, or the keyboard shortcut &quot;&#8984; + D&quot;. Then choose your image using the dialog box which appears.<br />
    Note: To make the most of the possibilities available in Patternshop, we recommend you import images using png file format to preserve transparency (8bit or 24bit png). </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> The image is imported into the pattern and is directly repeated in the network: </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataScreen"><img alt="screenshot" src="../graphics/screen018.jpg" /></div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> The image also appears in the Project window (see &quot;<a href="window_drawings.htm">The tracing pattern window</a>&quot;) in the associated pattern folder: </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataScreen"><img alt="screenshot" src="../graphics/screen019.jpg" /></div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> Using the Transformations window (see &quot;<a href="window_drawings.htm">The Transformations window</a>&quot;), make this image horizontally symmetrical by	preceding with a (-) symbol the value indicated in pixels, or in % in the Dimension W (width) field. To ensure vertical symmetry, you should precede with a (-) the value indicated in the Dimension H (height) field. </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataScreen"><img alt="screenshot" src="../graphics/screen020.jpg" /></div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> By combining these effects, and importing the same image a second time, you can get a result similar to this: </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataScreen"><img alt="screenshot" src="../graphics/screen021.jpg" /></div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> Comment: In a classic layout like this, Patternshop lets you move the images by using the keyboard arrows, thus allowing for extremely precise control of the distances between each motif, such as to find the ideal layout. </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> Once these actions have been completed, you can move on to <a href="tuto_step04.htm"> stage 4</a> to learn how to manipulate a pattern.
