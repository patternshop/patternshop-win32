  <div class="dataItem"> The arrow: </div>
  <div class="dataPar"> The arrow lets you select, move and change the size or shape of a pattern, motif or image. Click on an object to select it, and then the selection box will appear: </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataScreen"><img alt="screenshot" src="../graphics/screen003.jpg" /></div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> Selecting a motif, as in the illustration above, automatically selects the pattern which contains it. It is then possible to move an object by clicking on it, then moving the mouse while keeping the button pressed. The handles can be used, for their part, to modify the size and shape of objects; depending on the position of the mouse the cursor will change its look, indicating the different possible actions: swivel, rescale and, for patterns only, change tilt. </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataItem"> The hand: </div>
  <div class="dataPar"> The hand is used to move around in the document. Click then move the mouse while keeping the button pressed to move the view in the desired direction (this is useful when the document is not fully visible in the window). </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataItem"> The magnifying glass: </div>
  <div class="dataPar"> To zoom into the document you can use the magnifying glass. By clicking and moving the mouse while keeping the button pressed, the zoom level will be increased or reduced depending on whether the movement of the mouse is up or down.<br />
    Tip: To restore zoom to 100% (real size), double click on the &quot;magnifying glass&quot; tool.
