  <div class="dataPar"> The project window lets you instantly visualise the objects that make up your network, as well as organise and check their depth. </div>

  <div class="dataPar"> The Project window displays the objects by order of depth: those placed at the top of the list will be displayed above those placed lower. You can choose to display an object or not by clicking on the icon representing an eye, located to the left of each object (masking a pattern will also mask all the images it contains). The arrow alongside each pattern has the effect of expanding or reducing the tree. </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> Free images do not belong to any pattern, and all appear at the top of the list. You can change the order of patterns and move images from one to the other by dragging them with the mouse. Using the same method, It is possible to move images to the top of the list, turning them into free images, or vice versa.
