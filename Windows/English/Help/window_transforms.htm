  <div class="dataPar"> The &quot;Transformation&quot; window lets you arrange and rescale objects, as well as apply rotation and torsion. </div>

  <div class="dataScreen"><img alt="screenshot" src="image/screen005.jpg" /></div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> Just modify the value contained in one of the editing boxes to make the change. The &quot;Split&quot; section lets you divide the pattern into sub divisions (values must be at least 2 to have any effect), and thus makes it possible to position images precisely (keep the &quot;shift&quot; key pressed while moving a image so that it aligns to the grid of the pattern that contains it). </div>
  <br />
  <div class="dataPar"> The &quot;Link images to the pattern&quot; box has the effect of applying all modifications made to a pattern to the images it contains (rescaling, rotation). This option can also be activated when necessary by keeping the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key pressed during manipulation.
